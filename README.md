### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA by day and chronic stuff builder by night.

I love everything involving graphics, low level, and anything Rust.

I hope that you can find something that interests you around here.

Here's a brief list of personal projects I've put lots ðŸ’– into: 
- [mepeyew](https://github.com/davnotdev/mepeyew) - A lightweight, cross platform graphics abstraction
- [mewo](https://github.com/davnotdev/mewo) - A lightweight game engine ECS
- [ROOM](https://github.com/davnotdev/Room) - A 3D shooter for Hack Club's Sprig console
- [Subway Sprigsters](https://github.com/davnotdev/subway_sprigsters) - A subway surfers inspired game for Hack Club's Sprig console
